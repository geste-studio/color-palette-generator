## ðŸ¤– AI Contribution

Approximately 95% of this project's code was generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic) from a single paragraph of requirements sent by a designer via messenger. The AI assistance included:

- Complete Vue 3 component architecture
- Color conversion algorithms
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Tailwind CSS styling
- GitHub Actions deployment configuration

The original requirement was to create a color palette generator that would:

- Take a base HSL color
- Generate harmonious colors by incrementing hue
- Create shade variations for each color
- Allow copying in different formats (HSL/RGB/HEX)

This showcases the potential of AI-assisted development while maintaining high code quality and proper typing. Only minor adjustments and optimizations were needed after the initial AI-generated codebase.
